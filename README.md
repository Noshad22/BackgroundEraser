# BackgroundEraser

Simple tool which is using for detecting bacground on pictures and removing it.

# Why

It was need for one of my friend. May be it will be usefull for somebody.

# Dependencies
1) It was written on C++ VS 2008, but it is crossplatform
2) It uses Qt for loading picture.

# For Windows
Just open vcproj in VS in Visual Studio and complie it

# For *nix
Just remove vcproj file and print in shell 'qmake -project' then 'qmake' then 'make'. If you have some versions of Qt, you should try instead of 'qmake' something like 'qmake-qt4' or 'qmake4' or lake that.
